Post-doc studying things that wiggle in the wind. 

I am a Canadian currently living in the United Kingdom studying fluid-structure interactions in nature. In particular, I look at how interspecific variation or behavioural changes in posture can adapt aeroelastic responses to improve performance across a range of functions. Currently I am working on a project to study how bird feathers can encode flow information during flight through feather vibrations. 

In my spare time, I enjoy some climbing up mountains, skiing back down, and descending in to the depths of caves.
