Ph.D. student interested in fluid-structure interactions, active and passive coupled control of mechanical properties and flow-induced vibration, and computational and experimental methods for studying aeroelasticity in avian flight.

### More Information

My research investigates the influence of wing morphing on the mechanical properties of the soft tissue as well as the multi-element, feathered flight surface, and how these changes in mechanical properties will affect the wing's aeroelastic response during flight. I use a combination of experimental materials testing and vibrometry and computational fluid-structure interaction simulations.

The remaining 90% of my personality is all about climbing.
