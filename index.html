<h2>Greetings.</h2>
<p>
I am a Ph.D. student interested in fluid-structure interactions, active and passive coupled control of flow-induced vibration, 
and computational and experimental methods for studying aeroelasticity in avian flight.
</p>

<h3>More Information</h3>
<p>
My research investigates the influence of wing morphing on the mechanical properties of the soft tissue as well as the multi-
element, feathered flight surface, and how these changes in mechanical properties will affect the wing's aeroelastic response 
during flight. I use a combination of experimental materials testing and vibrometry and computational fluid-structure 
interaction simulations.
</p>
<p>
The remaining 90% of my personality is all about climbing.
